Homework 12

# Step 1
I created a jupyter notebook that pulled the needed information from the Nasa wesbite. The information included:
  - The latest Mars news
  - Mars facts
  - Mars Hemispheres
 
 # Step 2
 I scrapped the data using Python scrpit and attempted to connect it to a Mongo DB.
 Unfortunately this is where I ran into problems and could not properly connect the scrapped data to a MongoDB, which ultimately effected the outcome of my HTML.
 As a result, the wesbite is in template form but not full of the actual content that I intended. See Below:
